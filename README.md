TAEMS

This is the primary Java TAEMS implementation. Source files are included in the archive. It includes parsers for both textual-Taems as well as the preprocessor-Taems formats. Facilities are included to walk and reason about the structure after it is read in. The Taems Viewer functionality outlined below is included.
Version: 1.3.1
Platform: Java-compatible

TAEMS Viewer

This software allows you to graphically view textual taems files. The ttaems file is read in and parsed, and then used to generate a tree-like view of the structure. Nodes in the model can be moved about, and their contents textually displayed. Editing capabilities are also included.
Version: 1.3.1
Platform: Java-compatible

Java Agent Framework (Runtime)

This framework allows you to build agents using component-based programming. It is intended primarily as a development kit, not as an out-of-the box agent utility.
This download also includes the Taems and JAF-extensions libraries.
Version: 1.5.4
Platform: Java-compatible, (x86 Linux for scheduling)

Java Agent Framework (Source)

This is the Java source for the JAF agent framework. You only need this if you intend to modify the basic functionality offered by JAF. See the runtime package above if you simply want to create JAF-based agents. This source package can be used to create the jaf.jar file used by the runtime package.
Version: 1.5.4
Platform: Java-compatible

MAS Simulator

This is the MAS Simulator, which is designed to provide a concrete, deterministic, well-defined environment to test multi-agent coordination and negotiation. Source is included. It makes heavy use of the Taems representation to model activities. JAF agents are typically used to run in this environment.
Version: 1.4.2
Platform: Java-compatible

Utilities Library

This project builds the utilities library that is used by many of the other projects listed above.
Version: 1.0
Platform: Java-compatible

farm

farm is a distributed simulation environment, designed to model and test the scalability of agent and negotiation protocol designs. This distribution contains the source for a number of different plugins. It also includes several different agent domains. including a distributed sensor network, graph coloring, n-SAT and a simple reinforment learning testbed.
Version: 1.0
Platform: Java-compatible
